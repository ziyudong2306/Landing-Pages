						<img src="img/newsarticles.png"> -->                     
                    <p>After suffering for years from psoriatic arthritis, Phil Mickelson set out to find the safest, most potent form of legal medicinal cannabis gummies for treating a wide range of diseases, mental disorders, cancers, and conditions like he suffers from, psoriatic arthritis. After treating his psoriatic arthritis with CBD, Phil Mickelson had a mission to make this miracle gummies available to the masses.</p> 
                    <p>The golf icon teamed up with longtime friend and competitor, Tiger Woods, who has been dealing with back pain for years says CBD gummies is the only thing that has improved his condition. Together, the duo was determined to create something that would not only work effectively but would also be affordable for everyday Australian&apos;s.</p> 
                    <p>After years of painstaking research and advocacy, those goals are finally in hand with the launch of their new, legal medical-grade line of cannabis gummies that cures a variety of ailments.</p> 
                    <p>The duo unveiled the new fruits of their labor during a live television interview. During the meeting, Phil broke down the science behind it and revealed that you immediately feel the positive effects upon ingesting the great miracle gummies.</p> 
                    <p>Members of the live studio audience got to sample the product themselves, and the feedback was incredible, with many feeling relief for issues like anxiety and joint pain within just seconds.</p> 
                    <p>Now available to all Australians, <a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">Fairy Farms Hemp Gummies</a> is the product of years of research spanning multiple continents and continuous, very personal investments by both Phil and Tiger and other investors. As the founders, Phil and Tiger are so confident in the power of their CBD miracle gummies that they are now offering a <a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">buy 3 get 2 free offer</a> for Australian&apos;s who are suffering and are willing to give it a chance. Phil went on to say that their miracle gummies is so good that even big pharma is trying to shut them out of business.</p> 
                    <p>They also explained that the medicinal and recreational booms have also brought a massive rise in the number of different cannabis gummies producers, all operating under fluctuating, often ill-defined regulatory standards. &quot;We&apos;ve got a lot of &apos;garage scientists&apos; in the industry, who are well-meaning people--I don&apos;t think anyone gets up in the morning, goes to the garage, and thinks they&rsquo;ll make something poisonous that could hurt people,&quot; they said.</p> 
                    <p>"<a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">Fairy Farms Hemp Gummies</a> is the product of thousands of hours of research and development. We wouldn't sell something we didn't believe in or something that we couldn't stand behind. We take it personally, and our family members do too, and the benefits are just out of this world. The big and sometimes corrupt pharmaceutical monopolies of this country don't want you to know about this because it will cut into their profits" said Phil.</p>

                    <p id="waypoint">The cutting edge <a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">company extracts CBD</a> from legally grown medicinal grade cannabis plants using the &apos;green method&apos; of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with C02, noted that &quot;the butane, hexane, and flavoring used to process most consumer-grade CBD gummies out there can leave unwanted traces behind.&quot;</p> 
                    <p>"A lot of these other CBD brands just want to sell you a product with just enough CBD that it makes it legal for them to sell, it's just not a good product," Tiger added. "Cannabis is something I am very passionate about, if I thought this wasn't the best product out there I wouldn't put my name on it, period." said a very serious Tiger.</p>

                    <p>Over the last ten years, Tiger Woods has been tirelessly advocating for cannabis reform in states around the country, as well as on behalf of veterans. "These guys deserve it; they need it. They go to war for us and come back with PTSD and doctors shove dangerous and addictive pills down their throats. It's no mystery that it's all one big racket that's making pharmaceutical companies even more rich and powerful."</p> 
                    <p>Phil realized he needed to search for a cure after suffering from psoriatic arthritis for years. "I've been through it all with my psoriatic arthritis, I was put on a myriad of medications, most of them opioid-based, and the side effects were staggering," he said. "Then I started taking another, which was supposed to help with the side effects of the first medication I was taking. I tried homeopathic remedies, and everything my doctor and I could think of, and the powerful opioids almost destroyed my intestines."</p>

                    <p></p> 
                    <p>Phil and Tiger&apos;s bond over their daily chronic pain drove them to create <a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">a highly tailored form of CBD gummies</a> using SFE&apos;s powerful capacity for targeting and extracting specific chemicals. &quot;Listen, I am not a scientist, but I do have the money to invest in getting the best scientists on this planet behind this miracle gummies,&quot; Phil said.</p> 
                    <p>&quot;Every step of the way this has been worth it, we had a vision, all the time and money spent figuring out how to use [CBD] to work best for my family members and myself, and developing things I know work for me, and I want to share this gift with fellow Australia&apos;s.&quot;</p> 
                    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2> 
                    <p>Cannabinoid, or CBD, is a miracle product that everyone has been using to alleviate various conditions, including chronic pain, anxiety, nausea, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, addiction, cancer, diabetes, PTSD, alcoholism, depression and cardiovascular disease, and many other ailments.</p> 
                    <p>If you haven&apos;t already heard, Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis that has a wide range of therapeutic benefits. CBD is naturally occurring in the Hemp plant and according to the Australian government patent #6,630,507 it supercharges our bodie&apos;s natural healing ability. Cannabidiol is found to have particular benefits as a neuroprotectant, for example in limiting neurological damage following stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease and Parkinson&apos;s disease.</p> 
                    <p>The best part of <a target="_blank" href="https://raingers-thround.com/click">Fairy Farms Hemp Gummies</a> is that it does not contain THC. THC is the component in recreational marijuana that gets smokers that "high" feeling while the real medical benefits come from the nonpsychoactive component, Cannabidiol.</p>

                                    <p>So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally pay out of pocket hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I'm ready to try something all-natural.</p>
